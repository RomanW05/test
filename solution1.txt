# MailChimp
Send newsletter to all your subscriber's

# Mail-Chimp


# NOTES:

1. You have been working on a project and already have a populated subscribers list (otherwise this program is completely useless)

2. This program is suited for goaffpro but can be modified for any other service by modifying "insert_ambassador_into_db.py"


# INSTALL:

1. Create a database to transfer that list to the database. Create tables:

	Table name: subscribers
	Fields:
		"id" -> Primary Key
		"name" -> string
		"email" -> string
		"subscribed" -> boolean
		"hashed" -> string, md5
		"newsletter_number" -> string, 1_2
		"time_stamp" -> string, date the email was opened
		"OS" -> string, subscribers OS
		"browser" -> string, subscribers browser and version
		"country" -> string, subscribers country
		"city" -> string, subscribers city
		"coupon" -> string, special coupon discount

	Table name: newsletters_sent
	Fields:
		"ambassadors_total" -> string
		"newsletter_number" -> string
		"date" -> string

	Table name: opened_emails
	Fields:
		"hashed" -> string
		"newsletter_number" -> string
		"time_stamp" -> string
		"OS" -> string
		"browser" -> string
		"country" -> string
		"city" -> string
		
	Table name: unsubscribed_time
	Fields:
		"hashed" -> string
		"email" -> string
		"time_stamp" -> string

	The field "newsletter_number" consists of (1_2), being "1" the newsletter number edition and "2" the subdivision within the newsletter itself.
	A newsletter has 3 subdivisions all of then which are trackable:
		Beginning (1), the subscriber scrolls up to the first image of the newsletter
		Middle (2), the subscriber scrolls up to the second image of the newsletter
		End (3), the subscriber scrolls up to the third image of the newsletter

2. Change the .htaccess file from your website, all files want to stay hidden. Add:
	Addhandler application/x-httpd-lsphp .html
	IndexIgnore *

3. Upload images:
	-Images to be displayed on the newsletter to your website.
		The images file name should be easy to remember and have the same schema as the "newsletter_number" field,
		for example 1_3.png, as they will be stored in the database for future reference and later analysis. 

4. Upload files:
	"update_db.php" upload into your website and copy the full path to that file: "www.example.com/hidden_content/update_db.php" and paste it into "insert_subscriber_into_db.py".
	"unsubscribe_user.php", self explanatory.
	"resubscribe.php". A subscriber unsubscribe by mistake or regrets the dessition. We have a botton after to display after the
		"You have been successfully unsubscribed" page so the chances of keeping the subscriber are higher.
	"request_image.php". Instead of displaying a normal picture, we ask for this file to handle us the picture instead and thanks to it we can track how far down the line
		the subscriber is at.
	"redirect_to_website.php". When some subscriber is interested and clicks a link of the newsletter we track it thanks to this file.
	"newsletter_tracker.php". Fetches all possible data about the user.
	"give_db_server.php" will give us the list [id, name, email, subscribed, hashed]. That way we know who to send the emails to.
		Remember that we don't want to send an email to an unsubscribed user.
	"emails_sent_server.php". Track the sent newsletters so you don't end up seding the same newsletter twice.
	"delete_repeated_emails.php" deletes subscribers with the same email.
	"request_image.php" all images are requested through this file. Tracks the subscriber.

5. Modify files:
	-"insert_ambassador_into_db.py" with your own credentials. Use any service you like, I used goaffpro but modify accordingly to fit your needs.
	Execute the script to automatically transfer the subscribers from your own service into your database.
	This script will fetch the subscribers list from your service (goaffpro or similar), take each individual subscriber,
	hash their email address and call "update_db.php" which will add a new entry into the Subscribers table of the database,
	it will then iterate over the entire list of subscribers.
	-"resubscribe.php" -> echo "You have been resubscribe to YOUR_COMPANY..." with the name of your company
	-"unsubscribe_user.php" -> echo "You have been successfully unsubscribed from YOUR_COMPANY..."  with the name of your company
	-"unsubscribe_user.php" -> echo "If you clicked 'unsubscribe' by mistake and want to be part of our family
		click <a href='https://www.example.com/hidden_files/resubscribe.php"  with the path of your uploaded file
	-"give_db_server.php" -> $passwordy. Match your 
	-Set your own credentials for:
		-"delete_repeated_emails.php"
		-"emails_sent_server.php"
		-"redirect_to_website.php"
		-"request_image.php"
		-"resubscribe.php"
		-"unsubscribe_user.php"
	-"update_database.php" -> $passwordy. Matching that password from "create_send_newsletter.py"
